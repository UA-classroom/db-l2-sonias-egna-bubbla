"""
This file is responsible for making database queries, which your fastapi endpoints/routes can use.
The reason we split them up is to avoid clutter in the endpoints, so that the endpoints might focus on other tasks 

- Try to return results with cursor.fetchall() or cursor.fetchone() when possible
- Make sure you always give the user response if something went right or wrong, sometimes 
you might need to use the RETURNING keyword to garantuee that something went right / wrong
e.g when making DELETE or UPDATE queries
- No need to use a class here
- Try to raise exceptions to make them more reusable and work a lot with returns
- You will need to decide which parameters each function should receive. All functions 
start with a connection parameter.
- Below, a few inspirational functions exist - feel free to completely ignore how they are structured
- E.g, if you decide to use psycopg3, you'd be able to directly use pydantic models with the cursor, these examples are however using psycopg2 and RealDictCursor

### THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF A FUNCTION FOR INSPIRATION FOR A LIST-OPERATION (FETCHING MANY ENTRIES)

### THIS IS JUST INSPIRATION FOR A DETAIL OPERATION (FETCHING ONE ENTRY)
# def get_item(con, item_id):
#     with con:
#         with con.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor) as cursor:
#             cursor.execute("""SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = %s""", (item_id,))
#             item = cursor.fetchone()
#             return item


### THIS IS JUST INSPIRATION FOR A CREATE-OPERATION
# def add_item(con, title, description):
#     with con:
#         with con.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor) as cursor:
#             cursor.execute(
